# Sudoku Solver
Welcome to my Sudoku Solver Visualizer! Inspired by a short Java program we wrote in my Data Structures and Algorithms course, I wanted to take it to the next level by using what I learned from my [Udemy Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). My goal was to make it playable, visualize the solver, and easy to navigate by creating a responsive web application. You can access it here: https://gsechkin.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/
